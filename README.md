# SwiftUI-AudioPlayer

## Pet project

Meditation app. It could be a music player app too, the concept is the same.

- Enable audio playing with AVAudioPlayer from AVKit and use Combine and MVVM design pattern to connect programming logic and data to the views. We'll also turn the control buttons in the playback view into actionable items such as play, pause, backward, forward, stop and repeat.

Thanks to [designcode.io](designcode.io) for the tutorial!
